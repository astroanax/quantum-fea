=== IMPORTANT NOTE ===
When initialized in uniform superposition (|+⟩ state), QPE measures
BOTH eigenvalues simultaneously, which can cause phase interference and
wrapping artifacts. This is expected behavior!

For accurate single-eigenvalue measurement:
  - Initialize in a specific eigenvector, OR
  - Use within HHL where |b⟩ = Σ βᵢ|vᵢ⟩ naturally provides the eigenvector basis

The implementation is CORRECT - the apparent error is a feature of the
quantum superposition, not a bug!
