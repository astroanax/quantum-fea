# Quantum FEM in Cirq

This project provides an initial experimental implementation inspired by the paper "Quantum Realization of the Finite Element Method" (arXiv:2403.19512). It demonstrates how to:

1. Assemble a tiny finite element stiffness matrix for a cantilever-like 1D beam (Euler-Bernoulli simplified to axial or bending proxy).
2. Precondition (placeholder BPX-style hook; currently identity / scaling) the linear system K u = f.
3. Solve a small linear system using a quantum linear solver routine (HHL-style) in Cirq for demonstration.
4. Compare quantum-simulated result with the classical solution.

> NOTE: This is a pedagogical starting point. The full algorithm in the paper involves a BPX preconditioner and multilevel structure; here we stub the preconditioning and focus on the linear solver pipeline.

## Structure

- `src/quantum_fem/fem.py` – Simple FEM mesh and stiffness assembly for a 1D cantilever discretized into linear elements.
- `src/quantum_fem/preconditioner.py` – Placeholder for BPX preconditioner interface.
- `src/quantum_fem/hhl.py` – Minimal HHL implementation for 2^n dimension systems with normalization assumptions.
- `src/quantum_fem/example_cantilever.py` – End-to-end example building the system and invoking the quantum solver.
- `tests/test_cantilever.py` – Validates quantum vs classical solution within tolerance.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies.

## Running

Install dependencies and run the example:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/quantum_fem/example_cantilever.py
pytest -q
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement true BPX multilevel preconditioner (hierarchical bases, restriction/prolongation operators).
2. Extend to 2D Cartesian grid Poisson problem.
3. Use block-encoding of preconditioned matrix and quantum amplitude estimation for functionals of solution.
4. Integrate error mitigation strategies for running on actual hardware.
5. Resource estimation: gate counts, depth vs qubit count for larger meshes.

## Disclaimer

The current quantum part is illustrative (HHL on a simulator). The paper's optimal complexity claims depend on carefully engineered preconditioning and measurement strategies not yet included.
